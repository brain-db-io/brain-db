# Contributing to Brain

Thanks for considering a contribution. Brain has strong design
constraints — read this end-to-end before you start.

## TL;DR

1. The [spec](spec/) is authoritative. Code disagreements get
   fixed in the code, not the spec. Spec changes go through
   the maintainer.
2. Every sub-task: **read the spec → read the phase doc → write
   a plan in `.claude/plans/phase-NN-task-MM.md` → wait for
   approval → implement → verify → commit**.
3. No `unwrap()` outside tests. Use `expect("invariant:
   <reason>")` for unreachable.
4. Run `just verify` (or `cargo zigbuild --target
   x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --workspace --tests` on macOS)
   before opening a PR.

See [`AUTONOMY.md`](AUTONOMY.md) for the full operating
contract Brain's autonomous mode runs under — much of it
applies to human contributors too.

## Architecture in one paragraph

Linux server. Connection layer (Tokio) accepts TCP; each
request dispatches to one of N **shards**. Each shard runs a
**Glommio** executor (thread-per-core, io_uring) and owns its
data: a memory-mapped **arena** for vectors, a **WAL** with
O_DIRECT + `pwritev2(RWF_DSYNC)` group commit, a **redb**
B-tree for metadata, an **HNSW** index in RAM.
Single-writer-per-shard, lock-free reads via
**ArcSwap** + **crossbeam-epoch**. When a schema is declared,
the same shard additionally owns entity / statement HNSWs,
two **tantivy** indexes, an LLM extractor cache, and runs the
three-tier extractor pipeline.

## Where to start reading

- [`README.md`](README.md) — what Brain is + capability tour.
- [`spec/00_master_overview/`](spec/00_master_overview/) — design
  start.
- [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) — phase index.
- [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) — operating rules + invariants.
- [`docs/development/`](docs/development/) — contributor
  workflow.

## Core invariants — DO NOT violate

Code that violates these is wrong regardless of test results:

1. **WAL-before-acknowledge.** No operation returns success
   until its WAL record is fsynced.
2. **Single writer per shard.** No locks needed; the discipline
   enforces it.
3. **CRC everywhere.** Every WAL record + arena slot.
4. **Slot version on `MemoryId`.** Stale references →
   `NotFound`.
5. **Idempotency by `RequestId`.** 24h TTL. Same params →
   cached response. Different params → `Conflict`.
6. **Tombstone grace before reclamation.** Default 7 days. Hard
   FORGET zeroes immediately.
7. **No silent corruption.** Fail-stop and alert.

## Anti-patterns

- Don't add Tokio inside a shard. Shards use Glommio.
- Don't hold a lock across `.await`.
- Don't allocate in the hot path (encode/recall serving).
- Don't add `Send + Sync` to per-shard types.
- Don't use `tokio::fs` in shard code.
- Don't introduce a thread pool for parallel work. Sharding is
  the parallelism.
- Don't trust user input. All wire input is untrusted.
- Don't `panic!` on user-input errors.

## Workflow

### 1. Pick a sub-task

The lowest-numbered unfinished sub-task in the active phase
doc. Use `/next-task` if you're in Claude Code.

### 2. Read the spec

The spec section that section governs the work. Don't infer
from the code if the spec covers it — read the spec.

### 3. Plan

Write `.claude/plans/phase-NN-task-MM.md` with:
- Scope.
- Spec references.
- Architecture sketch.
- Trade-offs considered.
- Risks / open questions.
- Test plan.
- Commit shape.
- Confirmation questions.

Wait for approval before coding. This isn't ceremony — most
mistakes are caught at the plan step.

### 4. Implement

Follow the plan. Deviations go back through plan → approval.

### 5. Verify

```bash
just verify
# or, on macOS:
cargo zigbuild --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --workspace --tests
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo fmt --check
```

### 6. Commit

One commit per sub-task. Commit subject:

```
<type>(<scope>): <NN.MM> — <summary>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`,
`perf`.

**Never** add a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer. The user is
the sole author of these commits.

## Code conventions

- Edition: Rust 2021. MSRV: stable latest minus one.
- Errors: `thiserror` for libs; `anyhow` for binaries. Stable
  error taxonomy per spec §03/10.
- No `unwrap()` outside tests. Use `expect("invariant:
  <reason>")` for unreachable.
- Public APIs: rustdoc + at least one example for non-trivial.
- No `unsafe` outside `crates/brain-storage`. That crate needs
  it for mmap. Every `unsafe` block: `// SAFETY:` comment,
  smallest scope.
- Formatting: rustfmt defaults.
- Lints: clippy default warnings as errors in CI. Pedantic is
  aspirational; not enforced on stubs.
- Naming: snake_case items, CamelCase types — Rust standard.

## Testing

- Unit tests colocated.
- Integration tests in `tests/` per crate.
- Property tests with `proptest` for parsers, allocators,
  recovery.
- Fuzz with `cargo-fuzz` for the wire protocol.
- Loom for concurrency-critical paths.
- Miri for `crates/brain-storage`'s unsafe.
- Chaos tests for recovery (kill-during-operation).
- Benchmarks with `criterion` per phase.

New behaviour → new test. Spec change → corresponding test
change.
