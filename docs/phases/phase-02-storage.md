# Phase 2 — Storage: Arena + WAL + Recovery

## Goal

Implement the durable storage layer: a memory-mapped vector arena, a write-ahead log with group commit, and a crash-recovery procedure. After this phase, you can write vectors and metadata records, kill the process at any byte offset, and recover to a consistent state on restart — for every operation that returned a "success" before the kill.

## Prerequisites

- [x] Phase 1 complete (`phase-1-complete` tag).
- `brain-core` exports `MemoryId` and the slot-version concept.

  - `Arena` (thread-per-shard handle to the mmap'd vector file)
  - `Wal` (per-shard WAL writer with group commit)
  - `WalReader` (record stream)
  - `Recovery::run(...)` (recovery driver)
  - `Lsn` (newtype around u64)
  - `SlotRef` (wraps slot index + version)
- A faked-metadata test harness so storage can be tested in isolation.
- 1000-iteration random-kill recovery test passing.
- Tag: `phase-2-complete`.

## Sub-tasks

### Task 2.1 — `Lsn` newtype and `WalRecord` framing ✅

**Reads:** `spec/05_storage_arena_wal/05_wal_records.md`

**Writes:** `crates/brain-storage/src/wal/record.rs`, `crates/brain-storage/src/wal/kinds.rs`

**What to build:**
- `pub struct Lsn(u64)` with `next()`, ordering, `Display`.
- `pub struct WalRecord { lsn: Lsn, kind: WalRecordKind, payload: Vec<u8>, crc: u32 }`
- Encode/decode for the on-disk layout (length prefix, kind byte, payload, CRC) per spec.

**Done when:**
- [x] Round-trip tests for every `WalRecordKind`.
- [x] Truncated-record detection: a partial record at end-of-stream returns `Truncated`, not a parse error.

**Pitfalls:** torn writes — the decoder must distinguish "ran out of bytes mid-record" (truncated, normal at tail) from "bytes looked complete but CRC failed" (corruption).

---

### Task 2.2 — Typed `WalPayload` per spec §05/05 ✅

**Reads:** `spec/05_storage_arena_wal/05_wal_records.md`

**Writes:** `crates/brain-storage/src/wal/payload.rs` (and small bridge in `record.rs`)

**Design note:** rather than retrofit data variants onto the discriminator-only `WalRecordKind` enum from 2.1 (which would conflate the wire byte with the typed meaning and invalidate the framing tests), the typed layer lives in a parallel `WalPayload` enum. `WalPayload::kind() -> WalRecordKind` and `WalRecord::from_typed` / `WalRecord::typed_payload` bridge the two layers. Spec §05/05's "rkyv-serialized" prescription is replaced with hand-encoded LE byte layouts that match the spec's §§5–16 byte tables exactly; rkyv's generated layouts wouldn't match the spec's prescribed field order.

**Done when:**
- [x] Every spec'd kind has a variant (15 of 15).
- [x] Per-variant payload round-trip tested.

---

### Task 2.3 — Arena slot byte layout ✅

**Reads:** `spec/05_storage_arena_wal/02_arena_layout.md`

**Writes:** `crates/brain-storage/src/arena/slot.rs` (and `arena/mod.rs`)

**What was built** (corrected against spec §05/02 §3.2 — the original sketch in this phase doc named the wrong fields):
- `#[repr(C, align(64))] struct Slot { vector: [f32; 384], metadata: SlotMeta }` — exactly 1600 bytes, 64-byte aligned, no implicit padding.
- `SlotMeta` (64 bytes, `#[repr(C)]`) carries the spec's bookkeeping: `slot_version`, `flags`, `embedding_model_fp_short`, `created_at_unix_nanos`, `last_modified_at_unix_nanos`, `metadata_crc32c`, and a 20-byte reserved tail. **Agent/context/kind/salience are NOT in the slot — those live in the metadata store (redb), not the arena.**
- `metadata_crc32c` lives *inside* SlotMeta at metadata-offset 40 (slot-offset 1576), not as a trailing field on the slot. CRC covers `vector || metadata[0..40]`. (Spec §3.2's literal "[0..36]" splits `last_modified_at` mid-field; we treat that as a typo and cover `[0..40]`. See `.claude/plans/phase-02-task-03.md` §3.1.)
- `Slot::compute_crc / refresh_crc / is_valid` plus flag accessors (`is_occupied`, `is_tombstoned`, `is_pending_write`, `is_hard_forgotten`, `set_flag`).

**Done when:**
- [x] `assert_eq!(size_of::<Slot>(), SLOT_SIZE_BYTES)` — checked at compile time and runtime.
- [x] `align_of::<Slot>() == 64` — checked at compile time and runtime.
- [x] CRC verifies for a roundtripped slot — plus corruption tests for vector and covered metadata, stability tests for uncovered metadata, and a property test sweeping the uncovered region.

**Pitfalls:**
- Padding must be explicit (named field) to satisfy `bytemuck::Pod`. No implicit holes. Verified by `const _: () = { assert!(size_of::<...>() == ...); assert!(offset_of!(...) == ...); };` static blocks.
- Vector dimension is 384 (BGE-small) for v1; vector occupies bytes 0..1536. The slot is *not* oversized for larger models — the v1 file format pins 1600 bytes per spec §05/02 §3.

---

### Task 2.4 — Arena file: open, mmap, grow ✅

**Reads:** `spec/05_storage_arena_wal/{01,02,03}*.md`, `spec/01_system_architecture/05_hardware.md` §1.1

**Writes:** `crates/brain-storage/src/arena/file.rs` (and `arena/mod.rs`)

**What was built** (corrected against spec — original sketch used `MmapMut` from `memmap2`, which doesn't expose `mremap`):
- `ArenaFile` — owns one shard's `arena.bin`. Hand-rolled mmap region (`NonNull<u8>` + `file_size` + `capacity_slots`). Hand-rolled because `memmap2` would force the spec's *fallback* growth path (§05/03 §5) instead of the prescribed `mremap(MREMAP_MAYMOVE)` primary path (§05/03 §4).
- `open(path, shard_uuid, initial_capacity_slots)` — creates a new arena (`fallocate` → mmap → header init → `msync(MS_SYNC, header_page)`) or validates an existing one (magic → CRC → format/dim/size → uuid → file-size consistency, in spec §05/02 §11 order).
- `slot(&self, idx) -> &Slot` and `slot_mut(&mut self, idx) -> &mut Slot` — pointer arithmetic into the mmap; single-writer enforced by the borrow checker.
- `grow_to(&mut self, new_capacity_slots)` — `fallocate` → `mremap(MREMAP_MAYMOVE)` → header update (capacity + last_grow_at + CRC) → `msync(MS_SYNC, header_page)`. No-op on equal capacity; `ShrinkRequested` error on shrink (spec §05/03 §8: "The arena does not shrink in v1").
- `Drop` calls `munmap`. `madvise(MADV_RANDOM | MADV_DONTDUMP)` per spec §01/05 §1.1 (non-fatal; logs at warn).
- Header CRC covers bytes `[0..80]` — same `[0..N]`-cuts-a-u64 typo pattern as the slot CRC (spec literal `[0..76]` would split `last_grow_at`); see `.claude/plans/phase-02-task-04.md` §3.1.
- `HeaderRaw` is `#[repr(C)]` `bytemuck::Pod`, with a `const _: () = { assert!(...); };` block enforcing every field offset and the 4096-byte total at compile time.
- `Send + Sync` impls justified inline (single-owner mmap; reads through `&self`, writes through `&mut self`).

**Done when:**
- [x] Open + read + write + grow + reopen → all data preserved.
- [x] Concurrent reads of disjoint slots compile (by passing through a shared handle) — proven by `two_slot_refs_coexist_through_shared_self` test.

**Pitfalls:**
- `unsafe` is required here. Each block carries a `// SAFETY:` comment with the smallest scope that compiles.
- **Use-after-munmap**: error paths in `open_existing` were initially calling `munmap` then reading `header_view.field` — caught by SIGSEGV under cargo test parallel runner. Fix: snapshot every header field into locals before any path that might munmap.
- mmap remap: `mremap(MREMAP_MAYMOVE)`; the kernel may relocate, which is fine because `&mut self` prevents any concurrent borrows.
- Don't store `&mut Slot` borrows across calls that might grow the arena — `&mut self` borrow of `ArenaFile` enforces this at the type level.

**New deps:** `libc = "0.2"` (workspace pin) — direct usage of `mmap`, `mremap`, `munmap`, `fallocate`, `msync`, `madvise`. `tracing.workspace = true` for non-fatal `madvise` failures.

---

### Task 2.5 — Slot allocator with free list and version bumping ✅

**Reads:** `spec/05_storage_arena_wal/01_arena_overview.md` §10, `02_arena_layout.md` §3.2 + §8, `07_write_path.md` §2, `03_arena_growth.md` §2, `spec/02_data_model/03_identifiers.md` §2.

**Writes:** `crates/brain-storage/src/arena/allocator.rs` (and `arena/mod.rs`)

**Design note:** original phase-doc sketch had `free()` bumping the version. Spec §05/07 §56 puts the bump at *alloc* time (`new_version = current + 1`). End-to-end behavior is the same ("alloc/free/alloc returns version+1") but the spec reading has a nice property: a crashed encode between `alloc` and WAL fsync doesn't burn a version, because the on-disk version is only updated when the encoder finalizes the slot. Plan §3.1 captures the rationale.

**What was built:**
- `SlotAllocator { free_list: Vec<u64>, next_fresh: u64, capacity: u64 }`. LIFO free list (spec §05/07 §1 "pop the head").
- `empty(capacity)` — fresh-arena constructor.
- `rebuild_from_arena(arena)` — O(N) two-pass classifier: pass 1 finds `next_fresh` = `max_used_idx + 1` (`OCCUPIED || PENDING_WRITE || slot_version > 0`); pass 2 adds every non-`OCCUPIED` slot below `next_fresh` to the free list (including never-used slots that happen to sit below the boundary — without this they'd be permanently lost).
- `alloc(arena)` — pops free_list or takes `next_fresh`; re-checks free-list slot is still free (spec §05/07 §1); computes `new_version = current + 1` with saturation handling per spec §05/02 §8; sets `PENDING_WRITE` on disk per spec §05/07 §48; returns `(idx, new_version)`.
- `free(arena, idx)` — clears all flags on disk (spec §05/02 §3.2 "After reclaim, both bits become 0"), refreshes CRC, pushes onto free list. Does not bump version.
- `version_of(arena, idx)`, `on_capacity_grow(new_capacity)` (panics on shrink per spec §05/03 §8).
- Saturation handling: both `alloc` and `free` return `*Retired` errors when version is at `u32::MAX`.

**Done when:**
- [x] alloc/free/alloc returns the same slot but with version+1 — `alloc_free_alloc_returns_same_idx_with_version_plus_one` and `version_progression_across_many_cycles` cover this.
- [x] Property test: a sequence of alloc/free operations leaves the structural invariant `used_count() + free_count() == next_fresh` true at every step.

---

### Task 2.6 — WAL segment writer (no fsync yet) ✅

**Reads:** `spec/05_storage_arena_wal/04_wal_overview.md`, `spec/05_storage_arena_wal/05_wal_records.md` §1 (segment header) + §17 (record packing)

**Writes:** `crates/brain-storage/src/wal/segment.rs` (and `wal/mod.rs` re-exports)

**What was built:**
- `WalSegment` — owns one `*.wal` file, owns an in-memory `Vec<u8>` write buffer.
- `create_new(path, segment_seq, starting_lsn, shard_uuid)` — `O_EXCL` (refuses to clobber); writes the 4 KB segment header synchronously with magic `"BWAL"`, format_version, shard_uuid, segment_seq, starting_lsn, created_at_unix_nanos, header_crc32c, reserved.
- `append_record(&WalRecord)` — uses 2.1's `WalRecord::encode_into` to push bytes into the in-memory buffer. No disk I/O.
- `flush()` — drains the buffer to the file via `File::write_all`. **No fsync** (deferred to 2.8 with `pwritev2(RWF_DSYNC)` and group commit).
- `size_bytes()` — `WAL_SEGMENT_HEADER_LEN + bytes_on_disk + buffered`. Lets the manager in 2.9 decide rollover.
- `is_full()` — `size_bytes() >= WAL_SEGMENT_SIZE_BYTES`.
- Segment header CRC covers `[0..48]` — unambiguous (no `u64` cut mid-field, unlike the slot / arena-header / WAL-record CRCs from earlier sub-tasks).
- `#[repr(C)]` `bytemuck::Pod` `WalSegmentHeaderRaw` with `const _: () = { assert!(size_of/align_of/offset_of) };` enforcing every field offset at compile time.

**Done when:**
- [x] Records can be written and read back via `WalReader` (next task) — tested via `records_round_trip_through_disk` and `mixed_append_flush_sequence_preserves_order` (read raw bytes after flush and decode via `WalRecord::decode_one`; WalReader from 2.7 just wraps this pattern).

---

### Task 2.7 — `WalReader` over a directory of segments ✅

**Reads:** `spec/05_storage_arena_wal/05_wal_records.md` §§1, 17; `08_recovery.md` §§4, 10.

**Writes:** `crates/brain-storage/src/wal/reader.rs` (and `wal/mod.rs` re-exports)

**What was built:**
- `WalReader::open(dir, shard_uuid)` — lists `*.wal` files, parses `segment_seq` from filenames (strict 10-digit zero-padded), validates each header (magic `"BWAL"` / format_version / CRC `[0..48]` / shard_uuid / filename-vs-header `segment_seq` cross-check), sorts by `segment_seq`, validates the seq sequence is contiguous (spec §05/08 §10.1).
- `impl Iterator<Item = Result<WalRecord, WalReadError>>` — lazy-loads each segment into a `Vec<u8>` and decodes via `WalRecord::decode_one`. Strict LSN ordering checked at every record + at every segment boundary (spec §05/08 §4).
- Tail-vs-mid-segment rule (the load-bearing distinction): `Truncated` or `CrcMismatch` at the end of the **last** segment ⇒ clean iterator end (`None`, with a `tracing::info!` log); same outcomes on any earlier segment ⇒ `MidSegmentCorruption` error (spec §10.3). `UnknownRecordType` / `NonZeroReserved` / `PayloadTooLarge` always error.
- `FusedIterator` impl so callers can rely on `next` returning `None` after the first `None`/`Err`.
- `last_decoded_lsn()` / `next_expected_lsn()` accessors for the recovery driver to pick up.

**Done when:**
- [x] Round-trip: write 1000 records, read them back, all match (`write_1000_records_and_read_back` — the load-bearing test). Plus 14 other tests covering open failures, multi-segment streaming, tail truncation, mid-segment corruption (both truncation and CRC), and LSN ordering across segments.
- [ ] Truncate file mid-record; reader stops at the last good record.

---

### Task 2.8 — Group commit with `pwritev2(RWF_DSYNC)`

**Reads:** `spec/05_storage_arena_wal/06_wal_durability.md`

**Writes:** `crates/brain-storage/src/wal/group_commit.rs`

**What to build:**
- A queue of pending records, each tied to an oneshot channel for "your fsync is done."
- Single committer task: drains the queue periodically (or when full), calls `pwritev2` with `RWF_DSYNC`, signals all waiters.
- Use `nix` or raw libc for the syscall (and confirm with spec which is preferred).

**Done when:**
- [ ] Sequential ops: append → wait → file is durable.
- [ ] Concurrent ops: 100 appends batched into ≤ 5 fsyncs; all complete with success.
- [ ] Crash test: kill mid-batch, reopen, only records that signaled completion are visible.

**Pitfalls:**
- `RWF_DSYNC` requires kernel ≥ 4.7 (which is fine for any supported target).
- Group commit window: spec may pin a max latency (e.g. 5ms). Implement a configurable window.

---

### Task 2.9 — `Wal` public type

**Reads:** `spec/05_storage_arena_wal/07_write_path.md`

**Writes:** `crates/brain-storage/src/wal/mod.rs`

**What to build:**
- `pub struct Wal { ... }` — single public handle composing segment writer + group commit + reader.
- `pub async fn append(&self, record: WalRecord) -> Result<Lsn>` — returns the LSN once durable.
- `pub fn reader(&self) -> WalReader`.

**Done when:**
- [ ] End-to-end: write through `Wal::append` → read via `wal.reader()` returns the record.

---

### Task 2.10 — Recovery driver

**Reads:** `spec/05_storage_arena_wal/08_recovery.md`, `spec/15_failure_recovery/02_crash_recovery.md`

**Writes:** `crates/brain-storage/src/recovery.rs`

**What to build:**
- `pub fn recover(arena_path, wal_dir, metadata_sink: &mut impl MetadataSink) -> Result<RecoveryReport>`
- Algorithm per spec:
  1. Open arena and metadata-sink.
  2. Read last checkpoint marker → `durable_lsn`.
  3. Replay WAL records with `lsn > durable_lsn`; for each, apply to metadata-sink (idempotent) and update arena slots.
  4. Stop on torn-tail (acceptable) or CRC failure (halt with `Corruption`).
- `MetadataSink` is a trait; real impl in Phase 3, fake impl here for testing.

**Done when:**
- [ ] Recovery on a clean shutdown is a no-op (no records past durable_lsn).
- [ ] Recovery after a kill replays the WAL and matches the pre-kill state.
- [ ] Recovery is idempotent (running twice produces the same state).

---

### Task 2.11 — Random-kill recovery test

**Reads:** `spec/16_benchmarks_acceptance/06_durability_criteria.md`

**Writes:** `crates/brain-storage/tests/random_kill.rs`

**What to build:**
- Test that:
  1. Spins up a `Wal` and an arena.
  2. Issues N concurrent operations.
  3. At a random byte offset within the run, simulates kill (drops handles abruptly).
  4. Reopens via `recover(...)`.
  5. Verifies every operation that returned `Ok(lsn)` before the kill is durable.
  6. Verifies no other operations are visible.
- Run with N=100 ops, 1000 iterations.
- Use proptest or hand-rolled randomization with a seed printed on failure.

**Done when:**
- [ ] 1000 iterations, 0 failures.
- [ ] Failure mode (if any) prints a reproducible seed.

**Pitfalls:**
- "Drops handles abruptly" can't actually `kill -9` from inside a test. Approximate by `mem::forget` on the handles + manually replaying via `recover`. Document the limitation.
- For real `kill -9` testing, write a separate harness (Phase 11 chaos suite).

---

### Task 2.12 — Checkpoint writer

**Reads:** `spec/05_storage_arena_wal/09_checkpointing.md`

**Writes:** `crates/brain-storage/src/wal/checkpoint.rs`

**What to build:**
- `pub fn write_checkpoint(wal: &Wal, durable_lsn: Lsn, arena_size: u64)` — writes a `WalRecordKind::Checkpoint` record.
- Recovery reads the latest checkpoint to fix the start LSN.

**Done when:**
- [ ] Checkpoint written → recovery starts from `durable_lsn + 1`.
- [ ] Multiple checkpoints: recovery uses the latest.

---
