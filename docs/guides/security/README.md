# Security

**Audience:** anyone exposing Brain beyond a loopback interface.

**Goal:** *hardening*. Reduce the blast radius if something goes
wrong. Not vulnerability reporting (see
[`../../../SECURITY.md`](../../../SECURITY.md) for that).

## State of the world

Brain v1.0 ships with **`mode = "none"`** as the only fully-wired
auth mode. Token and mTLS auth are designed (spec §02/06
handshake) but deferred to Phase 14+. Until they land, Brain's
network policy
must be enforced at the boundary — not inside Brain.

That means: **never expose `listen_addr` directly to the public
internet**. Either:

1. Bind Brain to a private interface and route through a reverse
   proxy that authenticates and rate-limits, or
2. Sit Brain behind a service mesh (Envoy / Linkerd) that
   enforces mTLS at the mesh boundary.
