//! `FrameStream<T>` — the generic streaming engine that backs
//! every op's `send_stream()`.
//!
//! Owns the [`PoolGuard`] for its lifetime so back-pressure is
//! demand-driven: each `next().await` reads exactly one frame
//! off the socket. If the caller stops polling, no socket reads
//! happen and TCP backpressure propagates to the server.
//!
//! Retry is intentionally out of scope for streams: SUBSCRIBE's
//! `from_lsn` resume semantics require server-
//! side support that isn't wired in v1. Transient errors surface
//! to the caller, who can choose to re-open the stream.
