//! `ExtractorWorker` — drains the post-ENCODE extractor queue and
//! materialises entity / statement / relation / mention-edge rows
//! from the three-tier extractor framework's output.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Before this worker landed, ENCODE wrote a memory row and a vector
//! into HNSW and stopped there. The phase bodies's entities,
//! statements, and relations only appeared when an operator hand-wrote
//! them through `ENTITY_CREATE` / `STATEMENT_CREATE` / `RELATION_CREATE`
//! wire ops. ExtractorWorker turns ENCODE into a typed-graph-rich
//! operation: every encoded memory runs through pattern + classifier +
//! LLM tiers, items are resolved against the entity registry, and the
//! resulting graph rows are written transactionally.
//!
//! ## Flow per cycle
//!
//! 1. Drain up to `drain_per_cycle` `(memory_id, text)` pairs from the
//!    writer-fed channel.
//! 2. For each pair: probe the per-memory audit table; skip if already
//!    processed (queue-replay idempotency).
//! 3. Build a `brain_extractors::Memory` and an `ExtractionContext`.
//! 4. Run every enabled extractor in the registry.
//! 5. Merge the per-extractor outputs into one `Vec<ExtractedItem>`.
//! 6. Apply the merged result inside one redb write txn:
//!    - Resolve each `EntityMention` via the resolver gauntlet
//!      (exact / alias / trigram-fuzzy / create).
//!    - Write one `Mentions` edge per resolved entity
//!      (memory → entity, asymmetric).
//!    - Resolve each `StatementMention` / `RelationMention` against
//!      the in-cycle `surface → EntityId` map, intern the predicate /
//!      relation_type, and call the internal write helpers.
//! 7. Record an `ExtractorPipelineAuditEntry` and commit.
//!
//! ## Backpressure and failure
//!
//! - Full channel: writer drops the enqueue with a warn (encode never
//!   fails). Backfill is the recovery path (post-v1 admin op).
//! - Per-memory apply error: the worker logs at warn level and audits
//!   the memory as `PARTIAL_FAILURE` / `FAILURE` so a re-drain doesn't
//!   loop on the same memory.
//! - LLM tier unavailable: the registered LLM extractor returns
//!   `Failure(reason)` deterministically; pattern + classifier still run.
