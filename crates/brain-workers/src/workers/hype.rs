//! Write-time HyPE generation: hypothetical-question embeddings.
//!
//! HyPE is **mandatory and always-on**. There is no config flag to
//! disable it: every shard runs it, and the LLM it depends on is a hard
//! startup requirement (a keyless server refuses to boot — see
//! `brain_server::config::Config::validate_llm_provider`). The generator
//! is unconditionally wired into the extractor worker at shard spawn.
//!
//! For each freshly-encoded memory the generator asks an LLM for several
//! diverse questions whose answer is the memory, embeds each locally, and
//! both persists the vectors (`hype_question_vectors` table) and inserts
//! them into the live per-shard [`HypeHnswIndex`]. At read time the user's
//! query vector probes that pool — a hit on a stored question maps back to
//! the owning memory, bridging the query↔memory phrasing gap that the
//! direct passage embedding misses.
//!
//! Cost lands entirely here, at write time: the generation LLM call is
//! cached (keyed on the memory text) so a re-ingest is free, and it
//! respects the extractor worker's per-cycle LLM budget. The embedding is
//! the same local BGE model the rest of the write path uses.
