//! construct a `PlannerContext` without a live observability layer.
//! Phase 11+ wires real values from the monitoring layer.
//!
//! Two fields the cost model in 6.2 will use right away:
//! - `memory_count` — feeds `ann_search_cost(n, ef)`.
//! - `tombstone_ratio` — biases ef upward when tombstones dominate
