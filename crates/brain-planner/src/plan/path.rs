//! `PathPlan` — the plan for a `PLAN` request (the cognitive
//! operation, not the planner's output).
//!
//! Named `PathPlan` to avoid `ExecutionPlan::Plan(PlanPlan)` confusion.
//! describes the shape: embed both endpoints, RECALL
//! near each, traverse the graph between them via bidirectional BFS,
//! score paths, return.
//!
//! Phase 6.5 ships the **planner-side** shape. The executor is
//! deferred — bidirectional-BFS edge traversal lands with Phase 7
//! cognitive-ops alongside `LINK` / `UNLINK`.
