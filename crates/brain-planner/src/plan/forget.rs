//! `ForgetPlan` and its step structs.

//! — single-memory FORGET. The wire `ForgetRequest`
//! (Phase 1) carries only one `MemoryId`; batch + filter targets need
//! a wire bump and land later.
//!
//! Step ordering matches: WAL fsync → arena tombstone
//! → metadata commit → HNSW mark removed. The plan describes each
//! step; the writer task enforces the order at execution time.
