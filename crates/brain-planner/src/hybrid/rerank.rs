//! cross-encoder is loaded on the shard, the executor pulls the top
//! fused candidates' text from the per-shard `texts` table, calls
//! `CrossEncoder::score_pairs`, and re-sorts by relevance. The
//! filter chain then runs over the reranked list as usual. There is
//! no per-request toggle — the only control is the deploy-time
//! `config.rerank.enabled` load gate.
//!
//! When no cross-encoder is available (operator opted out, or the
//! model isn't bootstrapped on disk), the executor never reaches
//! this module and the RRF-only ordering is preserved.
