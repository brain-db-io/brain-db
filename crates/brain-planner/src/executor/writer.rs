//! Per-shard write surface: a channel-fed writer task that batches
//! encodes, group-commits to the WAL, and acks via a return channel.
//! This module ships only the **trait** — the real writer lands with
//! the workers and server.
//!
//! Tests use a `FakeWriterHandle` that drives the test `MetadataDb` and
//! `SharedHnsw` synchronously without WAL — enough to exercise the
//! interface but not the durability story.
