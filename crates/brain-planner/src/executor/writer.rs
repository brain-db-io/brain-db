//! Per-shard write surface. Spec §08/08 §10 describes a channel-fed
//! writer task that batches encodes, group-commits to the WAL, and
//! acks via a return channel. Phase 6 ships only the **trait** — the
//! real writer lands in Phase 8 (workers) / Phase 9 (server).
//!
//! Tests use a `FakeWriterHandle` that drives the test `MetadataDb` and
//! `SharedHnsw` synchronously without WAL — enough to exercise the
//! interface but not the durability story.
