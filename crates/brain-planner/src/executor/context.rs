//! The handle bag passed to every `execute_*` function.
//!
//! Handles are cheap to clone (Arc-based). Each executor task gets its
//! own handles; no contention. Every field is shareable across tasks
//! (Send + Sync).

//! Ships embedder + index + metadata (read side) + writer (write
//! side). An `arena: Arc<Arena>` field may be added later if a caller
//! needs raw arena access — current executors don't.
