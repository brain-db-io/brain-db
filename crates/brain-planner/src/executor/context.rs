//! The handle bag passed to every `execute_*` function.
//!
//! "handles are cheap to clone (Arc-based). Each
//! executor task gets its own handles; no contention." We use the
//! same pattern: every field is shareable across tasks (Send + Sync).
//!
//! Phase 6.4 ships embedder + index + metadata (read side) + writer
//! (write side). Future sub-tasks may add `arena: Arc<Arena>` if a
//! caller needs raw arena access — current executors don't.
