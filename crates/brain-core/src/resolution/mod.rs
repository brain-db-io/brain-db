//! Entity resolution: turning a surface name into a canonical `EntityId`.
//!
//! The resolver runs a tiered gauntlet — exact qname, alias, trigram
//! fuzzy match, then an HNSW embedding tie-break — and aggregates the
//! per-tier evidence into a confidence via noisy-OR. The supporting
//! pieces live alongside:
//!
//! - [`resolver`] — the gauntlet itself, `ResolutionOutcome`, config.
//! - [`trigrams`] — n-gram extraction + Jaccard similarity.
//! - [`confidence`] — noisy-OR aggregation with kind-specific decay.
