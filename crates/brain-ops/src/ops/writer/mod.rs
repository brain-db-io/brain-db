//! Real per-shard write surface.
//!
//! Implements `brain_planner::WriterHandle` against real
//! `MetadataDb` + `HnswWriter`. Idempotency lives here because spec
//! §08/04 §4 + §07/06 §3 mandate the lookup-then-act protocol with
//! the response payload written in the **same redb txn** as the
//! memory row.
//!
//! **No WAL** — spec §08/08 §10's group-commit channel-fed writer
//! lands in Phase 8 / 9. The trait surface doesn't change; production
//! swaps the implementation.
//!
//! Concurrency: every interior mutable piece is `Mutex`-wrapped.
//! Concurrent submits serialise on the metadata mutex; throughput is
//! bounded by redb's single-writer-per-database lock, which matches
//! the spec §07/08 §3 single-writer-per-shard discipline.
//!
//! ## Edge maintenance
//!
//! - **Encode-inline edges** (spec §09/02 §1.5): each `EncodeOpEdge`
//!   targeting a live memory is inserted into `edges_out` + `edges_in`
//!   via [`brain_metadata::tables::edge::link`], and the source /
//!   target memory rows' `edges_out_count` / `edges_in_count` denorms
//!   are bumped — all inside the same write txn as the memory row.
//! - **LINK** (spec §09/07 §1-§3): same pattern. `do_link` returns
//!   `already_existed=true` when the canonical `(source, kind, target)`
//!   was present (overwrite-weight semantics, no count bump).
//! - **UNLINK** (spec §09/07 §4-§5): non-existent edge is a no-op
//!   (`removed=false`), not an error. Successful unlink decrements
//!   both counts.
