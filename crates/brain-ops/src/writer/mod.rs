//! Real per-shard write surface.
//!
//! Implements `brain_planner::WriterHandle` against real
//! `MetadataDb` + `HnswWriter`. Idempotency lives here: the
//! lookup-then-act protocol writes the response payload in the
//! **same redb txn** as the memory row, so a replay can never observe
//! a committed row without its cached response.
//!
//! **No WAL yet** — the group-commit channel-fed writer lands later.
//! The trait surface doesn't change; production swaps the
//! implementation.
//!
//! Concurrency: every interior mutable piece is `Mutex`-wrapped.
//! Concurrent submits serialise on the metadata mutex; throughput is
//! bounded by redb's single-writer-per-database lock, which matches
//! the single-writer-per-shard discipline.
//!
//! ## Edge maintenance
//!
//! - **Encode-inline edges**: each `EncodeOpEdge`
//!   targeting a live memory is inserted into `edges_out` + `edges_in`
//!   via [`brain_metadata::tables::edge::link`], and the source /
//!   target memory rows' `edges_out_count` / `edges_in_count` denorms
//!   are bumped — all inside the same write txn as the memory row.
//! - **LINK**: same pattern. `do_link` returns
//!   `already_existed=true` when the canonical `(source, kind, target)`
//!   was present (overwrite-weight semantics, no count bump).
//! - **UNLINK**: non-existent edge is a no-op
//!   (`removed=false`), not an error. Successful unlink decrements
//!   both counts.
