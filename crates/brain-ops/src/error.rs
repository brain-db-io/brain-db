//! error taxonomy.
//!
//! `OpError` is brain-ops's runtime error type. Each variant maps to
//! a stable wire `ErrorCode` (`error_code()`) and carries a
//! `retryable` flag (`retryable()`) — both surfaced to clients per
//!
//! `#[from]` conversions wrap `brain_planner::PlanError` and
//! `brain_planner::ExecError` so handlers can `?` upstream errors
//! through without manual mapping. The `error_code()` mapping
//! collapses the inner variants to the right wire code.
