//! Knowledge-event emission helper shared across all wire handlers
//! that produce knowledge-layer events (entity / statement / relation /
//! schema / extractor-admin).
//!
//! Previously this helper lived inside `handlers/entity.rs` and was
//! imported by the other knowledge handlers — an awkward ownership
//! arrangement that perpetuated the "entity owns the cross-handler
//! event emission" pattern. Promoted to its own module so the
//! per-handler files only contain handler-specific code.
//!
//! ## Why this still exists post-Wave-4
//!
//! Substrate writes get WAL coverage through their *write* records
//! (`wal_map.rs` maps each substrate `Phase` to a typed `WalPayload`).
//! Knowledge writes (UpsertEntity / UpsertStatement / UpsertRelation /
//! UpsertSchema / MergeEntities / Tombstone(E/S/R) / Supersede(S/R))
//! don't yet have typed `WalPayload` variants — they ship via an
//! opaque `Knowledge(KnowledgeRecord)` carrier. Until `wal_map.rs`
//! grows arms for each knowledge `Phase`, knowledge events get WAL
//! coverage through this **event-side** path
//! (`OpsContext::publish_knowledge`).
//!
//! Once `wal_map.rs` is extended, this helper becomes redundant —
//! `submit::publish_events_for` (which bus-publishes substrate events
//! from `phase_to_envelope`) can also publish knowledge events, and
//! WAL recovery reconstructs them from the write records. That's the
//! future S-11.
