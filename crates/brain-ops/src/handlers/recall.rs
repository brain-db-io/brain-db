//! RECALL handler.
//!
//! RECALL is one verb, one code path: every request walks the same
//! plan → fan-out → fuse → filter → enrich → project pipeline. Shards
//! always wire all three retrievers (semantic + lexical + graph) at
//! spawn — there is no "substrate-only" fallback. A schema upload does
//! not gate retrieval; it only narrows what STATEMENT_CREATE /
//! RELATION_CREATE / predicate filters accept.
//!
//! In-txn reads: when the caller passes `req.txn_id`, the per-txn
//! buffer is overlaid on the committed result so RECALL inside a
//! transaction sees its own pending ENCODE writes (read-your-writes).
//! Tombstoned ids from the txn buffer are dropped from the committed
//! side before the merge.
