//! [`Write`] and [`WriteAck`] — the universal carriers.
//!
//! A `Write` is the unit of intent. A `WriteAck` is the result of
//! applying it. Single-op wire requests build a `Write` with one phase.
//! `TXN_COMMIT` builds a `Write` with N phases accumulated across the
//! transaction. Workers (edge derivation, reclamation, lifecycle)
//! build their own `Write`s and submit them.
//!
//! The writer doesn't distinguish among these origins. One queue,
//! one apply path, one WAL envelope, one event burst.
