//! brain-explore — terminal UI/UX layer for Brain.

//! Used by both `brain-shell` (the user-facing REPL/CLI) and `brain-cli`
//! (the admin/operator tool) so both binaries render with identical look,
//! flags, and policy. Owning color, hyperlink, pager, and table conventions
//! in one place is the only way to keep two CLIs from drifting apart over
//! time.
