//! End-to-end embedder tests that exercise the loaded BGE-small
//! forward pass. Two tests, both gated on `BRAIN_EMBED_MODEL_DIR`:
//!
//! 1. `encode_fingerprint_is_real_for_loaded_model` — the loaded
//!    model produces a non-zero fingerprint and a unit-norm, non-zero
//!    vector. This is the sanity assertion that the model actually
//!    ran (rather than returning a constant) and that downstream
//!    consumers (HNSW, wire) see a real signal.
//! 2. `distinct_texts_embed_to_distinct_vectors` — two clearly
//!    different sentences must produce clearly different vectors, and
//!    the same text must be deterministic across repeated calls. This
//!    is the cheapest possible "the model is actually running" check.
//!
//! Both tests bypass the brain-server frame harness and call
//! `Dispatcher::embed` directly. The harness coverage (wire fingerprint
//! round-trip, ENCODE→RECALL with a real model) lives in
//! brain-planner's `recall_with_real_embedder_end_to_end`; what's new
//! here is the per-vector property assertions on the live forward
//! pass, which the harness doesn't expose. If the wire path ever
//! diverges from `dispatcher.embed`, that's a separate bug — the
//! property assertions below would still hold against the dispatcher.

// Linux-gated because brain-server's brain-embed dep is itself
// Linux-gated. See embedder_startup.rs for the full reasoning.
