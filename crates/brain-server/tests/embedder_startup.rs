//! Integration tests for the process-startup embedder wiring landed
//! in H1 of the real-embedder rollout. Three tests:
//!
//! 1. `start_refuses_with_missing_model_dir` — always runs. Asserts
//!    that the bootstrap path returns an actionable "missing required
//!    model file" error when the resolved directory does not contain
//!    the three required files. This is the fail-stop contract that
//!    keeps operators from launching a server whose recall returns
//!    arbitrary vectors.
//! 2. `start_succeeds_with_valid_model_dir` — gated on the env var.
//!    Asserts that the same composition produces a working dispatcher
//!    with a non-zero fingerprint when the directory is populated.
//! 3. `dispatcher_fingerprint_is_consistent_across_clones` — gated.
//!    Catches a regression where the dispatcher accidentally re-loads
//!    the model per shard: every clone of the shared `Arc` must
//!    report the same fingerprint bytes.
//!
//! The brain-server binary's `linux_main::build_dispatcher` is
//! crate-private, so the tests mirror its composition
//! (`resolve_model_dir` → existence check → `ModelHandle::load` →
//! `CpuDispatcher::new` → `CachingDispatcher::new`). The composition
//! is the implementation detail; the contract under test is "given a
//! valid (or invalid) config, get a working (or failing-fast)
//! dispatcher". If the production composition drifts from what the
//! tests mirror, fix the test to match — the contract is unchanged.

// Linux-gated because brain-server pulls brain-embed in via
// `[target.'cfg(target_os = "linux")'.dependencies]` — the dep isn't
// available on macOS / Windows builds of the binary. The negative
// test could in principle live cross-platform, but bundling it with
// the gated tests keeps the surface coherent and matches the pattern
// used by every other brain-server integration test.
