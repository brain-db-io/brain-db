//! Enricher plugins — mutate candidate items between extraction and
//! persistence.
//!
//! The pipeline runs every registered enricher in registration order
//! after the pattern + classifier + LLM tiers complete and before the
//! resolver / persistence stages. Enrichers may add, mutate, or drop
//! items; downstream stages see the union of the modifications.
//!
//! Enrichers are sync — they MUST NOT block on tokio tasks, spawn
//! threads, or perform synchronous IO that exceeds a few microseconds.
//! Use plugin-side caches and pre-built indexes for any non-trivial
//! enrichment work.
