//! Connector plugins — pull from external sources before encode.
//!
//! A connector is a polled source of raw memories: it receives a
//! `since` watermark, returns items newer than the watermark, and
//! reports the next watermark to persist. The substrate's connector
//! scheduler (not in this slice) drives a per-connector cadence and
//! routes returned items through the encode pipeline.
