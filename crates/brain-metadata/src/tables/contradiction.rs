//! `statement_contradiction_audit` — durable record of Fact-vs-Fact
//! contradictions detected at `statement_create` time.
//!
//! When a new Fact disagrees with an already-active Fact on the same
//! `(subject, predicate)` (different object, overlapping validity), the
//! insert still proceeds — coexisting Facts are allowed — but the
//! conflict is recorded here so an operator can find and reconcile it
//! via `ADMIN_LIST_PENDING_CONTRADICTIONS`.
//!
//! The row is keyed by `(subject, predicate_id)`: at most one open
//! contradiction per subject+predicate, so re-detection updates the same
//! row rather than fanning out duplicates. The row is **self-contained**
//! — it stores the contradicting statement ids — so liveness is
//! re-checked directly against `statements` at list time (the
//! `statements_by_subject` index is single-value and cannot enumerate
//! coexisting Facts).
