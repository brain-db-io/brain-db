//! Recall@10 regression-detection test (sub-task 4.7).
//!
//! **This test does NOT validate the spec target.** Spec `§16/05 §2`
//! mandates recall@10 ≥ 0.95 at **1M memories** with realistic semantic
//! embeddings (BGE-small output). That measurement lives in
//! `benches/recall.rs` at 100K scale — closer to the spec scale and
//! the on-demand artifact.
//!
//! This integration test runs at 10K with synthetic clustered random
//! unit vectors — a measurably *harder* regime for HNSW than real
//! embeddings. We assert a **lower threshold (0.80)** here purely as
//! a CI regression gate: a code change that drops recall by more
//! than ~5 percentage points below the baseline should fail CI
//! without waiting for an operator to run `cargo bench`.
//!
//! Why synthetic recall undercounts: even with clustered data, in
//! 384-dim space tight clusters produce many near-ties at distance.
//! Exact-overlap recall@10 is sensitive to ties — HNSW may pick 10
//! different-but-equally-good neighbours than brute-force, scoring
//! low overlap despite being correct. Real BGE embeddings have more
//! distinct similarity structure; the recall numbers there reflect
//! the actual user-visible quality.
