//! Entity resolver used by the extractor pipeline worker.
//!
//! The extractor framework emits `EntityMention { entity_type_qname,
//! text, ... }` records before any persistence happens. The resolver
//! turns each surface form into a stable `EntityId` by walking a
//! gauntlet of lookup tiers:
//!
//! 1. **Exact** — normalize the surface form and look it up in the
//!    `(entity_type_id, normalized_name)` canonical-name index.
//! 2. **Alias** — look it up in the alias index keyed by the same
//!    normalized form.
//! 3. **Fuzzy (trigram + Jaccard)** — fetch trigram-overlap candidates
//!    from `entity_trigrams`, score them by Jaccard similarity over
//!    trigrams. If the best candidate's score exceeds
//!    [`DEFAULT_FUZZY_THRESHOLD`], add the surface form as an alias
//!    and return that EntityId.
//! 4. **Embedding (HNSW + cosine)** — when the caller wires an entity
//!    HNSW and an embedder, embed the surface form and ask the HNSW
//!    for the top-K nearest entities (`type_id`-filtered). If the top
//!    score is at or above [`EMBED_RESOLVE_THRESHOLD`], add the
//!    surface form as an alias and return that EntityId. This catches
//!    paraphrases trigrams miss (e.g. "Stripe Inc." vs
//!    "Stripe Payments").
//! 5. **Create** — mint a fresh UUIDv7 EntityId, intern the type if
//!    needed, embed the canonical name (when an HNSW is wired), and
//!    write the entity row + the HNSW slot. Synchronous population
//!    means subsequent resolves can hit the embedding tier immediately;
//!    a worker-driven HNSW backfill isn't required because entity
//!    creation is rare relative to statement creation.
//!
//! Determinism comes from the lookup contract: given the same DB
//! state + same surface form, the resolver always returns the same
//! EntityId. Tier-5 creates use UUIDv7 (time + random), so two
//! independent resolves of the same brand-new surface form against
//! the same DB produce different IDs only if both observe a
//! tier-1/2/3/4 miss — which is the intended split-brain semantics
//! for two simultaneous extractions.
//!
//! The embedding threshold defaults to 0.78 cosine. Operators can
//! tighten or loosen it via `BRAIN_RESOLVER_EMBED_THRESHOLD` (parsed
//! as an f32 in `[0.0, 1.0]`; invalid values fall back to the
//! default with a `tracing::warn!`). Callers that have no HNSW or no
//! embedder pass `None` for either and the tier silently skips —
//! the gauntlet still flows through tier-1/2/3/5 unchanged.
