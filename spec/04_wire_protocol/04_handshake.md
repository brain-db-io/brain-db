# 04.04 Handshake

The connection handshake establishes the protocol version, the session, and the authenticated agent. This file specifies the four frames involved: `HELLO`, `WELCOME`, `AUTH`, `AUTH_OK`.

## 1. The handshake sequence

```
Client                                    Server
  │                                         │
  │ TCP connect (and TLS, if enabled)       │
  │                                         │
  │ HELLO ────────────────────────────────► │
  │                                         │ (validate magic, version range,
  │                                         │  client_id, etc.)
  │ ◄──────────────────────────── WELCOME   │
  │                                         │
  │ AUTH ─────────────────────────────────► │
  │                                         │ (validate credentials, look up agent)
  │ ◄────────────────────────── AUTH_OK     │
  │                                         │
  │     [authenticated; operations flow]    │
```

After `AUTH_OK`, the connection is in the "established" state and operations can flow.

If the handshake fails at any step, the server sends an `ERROR` frame and closes the connection.

## 2. HELLO

The first frame the client sends after TCP/TLS establishment. Contains:

```rust
struct HelloPayload {
    client_id: String,              // human-readable; e.g., "my-app/1.0"
    supported_versions: Vec<u8>,    // protocol versions the client supports, e.g., [1]
    capabilities: HelloCapabilities,
    client_session_token: Option<[u8; 32]>,  // for resumption (not currently used)
}

struct HelloCapabilities {
    streaming: bool,                 // always true
    compression_zstd: bool,          // not currently used; reserved
    server_push: bool,               // not currently used; reserved
}
```

Frame layout:

- `opcode = 0x01` (HELLO)
- `stream_id = 0`
- `flags = EOS`
- `payload`: CBOR-encoded `HelloPayload`

### 2.1 client_id

A free-form string identifying the client. Used for logging and observability. Format suggestion: `"<client_name>/<version>"`, e.g., `"my-app/1.0"`.

Maximum length: 256 bytes.

### 2.2 supported_versions

The list of protocol versions the client can speak. The server picks one to use; see §3 below.

Currently this is `[1]`. As newer protocol versions are introduced, clients list both old and new.

### 2.3 capabilities

A struct of feature flags the client supports. The server's `WELCOME` confirms which the server also supports; the connection uses only mutually-supported features.

Currently the only required capability is `streaming = true`.

### 2.4 client_session_token

Reserved for future session-resumption (post-failover or after brief disconnects). Not currently used; clients send `None`.

## 3. WELCOME

The server's response to `HELLO`. Contains:

```rust
struct WelcomePayload {
    server_id: String,              // human-readable; e.g., "brain-server/0.5.0"
    chosen_version: u8,             // protocol version for this connection
    session_id: [u8; 16],           // server-allocated, unique to this session
    capabilities: HelloCapabilities, // mutually-supported
    server_features: ServerFeatures,
}

struct ServerFeatures {
    max_payload_size: u32,           // server's max accepted payload (default 16 MiB)
    max_concurrent_streams: u32,    // per-connection
    idle_timeout_seconds: u32,      // before server sends SERVER_PING
    auth_methods: Vec<AuthMethod>,  // which AUTH credentials the server accepts
}

enum AuthMethod {
    Token,
    Mtls,
    None,                            // for test/dev only
}
```

Frame layout:

- `opcode = 0x81` (WELCOME)
- `stream_id = 0`
- `flags = EOS`
- `payload`: CBOR-encoded `WelcomePayload`

### 3.1 chosen_version

The server picks the highest protocol version that:

- Appears in the client's `supported_versions` list.
- Is supported by the server.

If no mutual version exists, the server sends `ERROR(VersionNotSupported)` and closes.

### 3.2 session_id

A server-allocated unique identifier for this connection session. Format: 16 random bytes (cryptographically random, but doesn't need to be UUID-formatted).

The `session_id` is used in:

- Logs (correlating client and server logs for the same connection).
- Tracing (as a span attribute).
- Future session resumption (not currently used).

### 3.3 server_id

Free-form string identifying the server. Format: `"<server_name>/<version>"`. Maximum 256 bytes.

### 3.4 server_features

Server-declared parameters that affect client behavior:

- `max_payload_size` — clients MUST NOT send frames with payload exceeding this size. Default 16 MiB.
- `max_concurrent_streams` — clients SHOULD limit concurrent stream count to this. Default 1024.
- `idle_timeout_seconds` — after this much idle time, server sends `SERVER_PING`. Default 300 (5 min).
- `auth_methods` — which methods the server accepts in `AUTH`.

## 4. AUTH

The client's authentication credentials. Sent immediately after `WELCOME`.

```rust
struct AuthPayload {
    method: AuthMethod,
    agent_id: AgentId,                       // 16 bytes; the agent claiming identity
    credentials: AuthCredentials,
}

enum AuthCredentials {
    Token(Vec<u8>),                          // bearer token
    Mtls(MtlsClaim),                         // mTLS-presented certificate
    None,                                    // for test/dev only
}

struct MtlsClaim {
    cert_fingerprint: [u8; 32],              // SHA-256 of the client's cert
    asserted_subject: String,                // the subject the client claims
}
```

Frame layout:

- `opcode = 0x02` (AUTH)
- `stream_id = 0`
- `flags = EOS`
- `payload`: CBOR-encoded `AuthPayload`

### 4.1 method

The auth method the client is using. Must be one of those declared in `WELCOME.auth_methods`.

### 4.2 agent_id

The agent the client is identifying as. The server's authentication backend confirms (or denies) that the credentials authorize this `agent_id`.

This is the field that binds the connection to an agent. From this point on, every operation is authorized as this agent.

### 4.3 Token authentication

For `method = Token`:

- The token is opaque to the protocol — it's whatever the operator's auth system issued.
- Token validation is delegated to a configurable backend (JWT verification, OAuth introspection, or static-token tables).
- The server verifies the token and binds the agent_id.

### 4.4 mTLS authentication

For `method = Mtls`:

- The server already received the client's certificate during the TLS handshake.
- The `MtlsClaim` confirms the client's expected cert fingerprint and asserted subject.
- The server matches the asserted subject against its agent_id mapping (typically Subject Alternative Name or Common Name).

### 4.5 None

For `method = None`:

- No credentials. Allowed only when the server's policy permits.
- Used for test, dev, and trusted-network deployments.
- Server still binds the connection to the requested `agent_id`; trust is transitive from the network.

## 5. AUTH_OK

The server's acknowledgment of successful authentication.

```rust
struct AuthOkPayload {
    agent_id: AgentId,                       // confirmed agent_id
    bound_shard_id: u16,                     // runtime shard ID for this agent
    permissions: AgentPermissions,
    server_time_unix_nanos: u64,             // server's current time, for clock-skew check
}

struct AgentPermissions {
    can_encode: bool,
    can_recall: bool,
    can_plan: bool,
    can_reason: bool,
    can_forget: bool,
    can_admin: bool,                         // typically false for normal agents
}
```

Frame layout:

- `opcode = 0x82` (AUTH_OK)
- `stream_id = 0`
- `flags = EOS`
- `payload`: CBOR-encoded `AuthOkPayload`

### 5.1 bound_shard_id

The shard ID this agent is bound to. The client uses it for routing optimizations (knowing which shard owner serves the connection).

### 5.2 permissions

The agent's permitted operations. Typically all operations are allowed; admin operations require elevated permissions.

If the agent attempts an operation outside its permissions (e.g., calling `ADMIN_SNAPSHOT` without `can_admin`), the server returns `ERROR(PermissionDenied)`.

### 5.3 server_time_unix_nanos

The server's current time, for the client to check clock skew. If the client's clock differs from the server's by more than a configurable threshold (default: 1 second), the client SHOULD warn (some operations are time-sensitive).

## 6. Failure paths in the handshake

### 6.1 Bad HELLO

If the server rejects the HELLO (invalid magic, no mutually-supported version, oversize payload), it sends an `ERROR` frame and closes:

```
S → C: ERROR(stream_id=0, EOS)
       payload: {code: VersionNotSupported, message: "client supports [3,4]; server supports [1,2]"}
S: closes connection
```

### 6.2 Bad AUTH

If authentication fails, the server sends `ERROR` and closes:

```
S → C: ERROR(stream_id=0, EOS)
       payload: {code: Unauthenticated, message: "token rejected"}
S: closes connection
```

The error message MAY include detail about why auth failed (token expired, no matching agent, etc.) but SHOULD NOT include sensitive information.

### 6.3 Timeout

If the client doesn't send AUTH within a reasonable time after WELCOME (default: 30 seconds), the server times out and closes the connection.

If the server doesn't send WELCOME or AUTH_OK within a reasonable time (default: 30 seconds for each), the client times out and closes.

## 7. After the handshake

Once `AUTH_OK` is received, the client may send any operation. The server processes operations subject to the connection's permissions.

If the client tries to send operations before AUTH_OK (e.g., right after WELCOME, before sending AUTH), the server responds with `ERROR(NotAuthenticated)` and the operation is rejected.

## 8. Resumption (deferred)

The protocol reserves a `client_session_token` field in HELLO and a session_id mechanism. These are intended for future session resumption — re-establishing a connection without re-authenticating, useful for transient network failures.

Currently, resumption is not implemented. Disconnections require full re-handshake on reconnect. This is reserved for a future major version.

## 9. Multi-AUTH

Some applications would benefit from changing identity within a connection — e.g., a proxy serving many users wants to multiplex their identities over one underlying connection. Brain does not support this; one AUTH per connection.

For multi-tenant proxies, the recommended pattern is one connection per identity (subject to connection-pool limits). Multi-AUTH is an open question for a future major version.

## 10. Identity is bound to the API key, not carried in requests

Brain derives the caller's identity from the authenticated API key, not from per-request fields. The AUTH step issues a scope binding whose **authoritative claims are `(namespace, agent, permissions)`**: `namespace` is the tenant (company) data boundary, `agent` is the application within it, and the two together (`(namespace, agent)`) scope every operation on the connection. The key additionally carries a **non-authoritative `user` tag** — a human/service-account identity stamped onto audit rows for traceability ("who did it"); it is never an isolation boundary and never gates access. (The earlier `org` claim is removed: namespace *is* the company boundary.) Clients never construct or send a scope object; the server fills it from the key and resolves the namespace name to its interned `NamespaceId` once at AUTH.

This closes a class of impersonation bugs at the wire boundary. With identity carried in the request, a client that constructs the wrong `agent_id` or `namespace` could write into another tenant's space; with identity bound to the key, the same request is rejected at the handshake. Operations that legitimately act across agents *within a namespace* (admin migration, snapshot scope) require an admin key with explicit permissions; **no key can act across namespaces** — cross-tenant isolation is absolute.

Neither `agent_id` nor `namespace` is carried on client-facing requests; both are derived server-side from the authenticated connection key. The server rejects any request that carries a redundant `agent_id` or `namespace` field. A connection whose key resolves to no provisioned namespace is rejected (fail-closed; see [`./07_error_handling.md`](./07_error_handling.md) `NamespaceUnknown`) — there is no implicit/default namespace.

## 11. Handshake summary

The full handshake exchange:

```
[TCP, then optionally TLS]

C → S: HELLO              (32-byte header + ~100-200 byte payload)
S → C: WELCOME            (32-byte header + ~150-300 byte payload)
C → S: AUTH               (32-byte header + ~200-2000 byte payload, depending on method)
S → C: AUTH_OK            (32-byte header + ~50 byte payload)

[connection established; operations flow]
```

Total handshake bytes (typical): ~700-2000 bytes. Latency: 2 RTT after TCP/TLS, plus auth backend latency.
