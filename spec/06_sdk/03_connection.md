# 06.03 Connection Management

How the SDK manages TCP connections to Brain.

## 1. The connection pool

The Client maintains a pool of connections per server:

```
Client
  └── ServerConnections
        ├── Server: host1:9090
        │   ├── Connection 1 (idle)
        │   ├── Connection 2 (in use)
        │   └── Connection 3 (in use)
        └── Server: host2:9090
            ├── Connection 1 (idle)
            └── Connection 2 (idle)
```

Connections are reused across requests. The pool size is configurable:

- Default min: 1 per server.
- Default max: 8 per server.

## 2. Per-connection multiplexing

Each connection can carry multiple in-flight requests via stream IDs (per [`../04_wire_protocol/02_wire_format.md`](../04_wire_protocol/02_wire_format.md)).

So connection count × stream count = total concurrent requests possible.

For a default client (8 connections × 1024 streams = 8192 concurrent requests per server). More than most agents will ever use.

## 3. Connection establishment

When the SDK needs a new connection:

```
1. TCP connect to the server.
2. TLS handshake (if configured).
3. Brain protocol handshake:
   a. Send version + supported features.
   b. Receive server's version + features.
   c. Negotiate.
4. Authenticate:
   a. Send auth credentials.
   b. Receive auth ack or error.
5. Connection is ready.
```

All this happens at first use; subsequent requests reuse the connection.

## 4. The "first request slow" effect

The first request on a fresh connection is slower (connect + handshake + auth). Subsequent requests are fast (just protocol).

For applications wanting low first-request latency, pre-warming:

```rust
client.warm_up().await?;    // Pre-establish min connections
```

This establishes connections eagerly so the first real request is fast.

## 5. Idle connection management

A pool connection that's not currently serving an op is **Idle**. Idle
doesn't mean dormant — the SDK runs a per-Idle-slot background
reader that owns the stream and:

1. Reads frames continuously.
2. On `SERVER_PING` (the server's idle-detection probe per
   [§02/02 §6.1](../04_wire_protocol/01_design.md)):
   builds a `CLIENT_PONG` echoing the server's timestamp, writes
   it on the control stream (stream_id 0). Returns to step 1.
3. On any other frame: logs and discards (Brain doesn't issue
   unsolicited server frames outside subscribe streams, which run
   on their own connection).
4. On `Io` / `Closed` / `Protocol` error: exits. The slot will
   be marked closed on the next `acquire`, which triggers a fresh
   handshake (see §6).

When an op calls `acquire`, the background reader is cancelled, the
stream is handed back via a oneshot channel, and the resulting
active connection is returned to the caller. On `release`, the
stream is re-wrapped and a fresh background reader spawned.

### 5.1 Why a background reader

Without it, an idle pool slot has nobody reading frames. The
server's `SERVER_PING` sits in the kernel buffer; after
`ping_timeout` the server closes the connection silently. The next
op then hits EPIPE and recovers via §6 — correct but slow (one
round-trip wasted + handshake re-pay). The background reader keeps
idle connections genuinely alive so ops always run on a
known-healthy socket.

This matches the design space settled on by **gRPC**'s HTTP/2 PING
responder and **NATS**'s PING/PONG protocol. Bidirectional
`CLIENT_PING` (NATS-style, where the client also probes) is
documented in
[§02/02 §6.2](../04_wire_protocol/01_design.md) but not required —
the responder-only path satisfies the liveness contract;
bidirectional probes are an optimisation for detecting *slow* (vs
*dead*) servers.

### 5.2 Reaper

Independent of the background reader, the pool runs a reaper task
that closes Idle slots whose `last_used` exceeds the pool's
`idle_timeout` (default 5 min) — respecting `min_connections` as
the floor. The reaper exists for pool-size hygiene; the background
reader exists for server-side liveness. They don't interact.

## 6. Reconnection

The pool and the retry layer separate concerns:

1. The SDK observes `Io` / `Closed` / `Protocol` on an op
   (write or read).
2. The op handler marks the pool slot **failed** before
   propagating the error.
3. The slot drops; the pool transitions it to `Closed` instead of
   recycling the dead socket into the Idle list.
4. The retry layer ([§06/04](04_retries_and_streams.md)) gets the error,
   classifies it as retryable, and calls `acquire` again.
5. `acquire` finds no Idle slot (the previous one was just closed);
   `try_open_new` opens a fresh TCP + handshake under the
   pool's `max` cap.
6. The retry runs the op against the fresh connection. Succeeds.

Net effect: the user sees one extra ~50 ms of latency on the first
op after a network disruption — the re-handshake cost. They never
see the `NetworkError` unless retries are also exhausted.

The pool itself does NOT retry — that would conflate two concerns
(connection management vs op semantics). The retry layer's
[§06/04 §2](04_retries_and_streams.md) classifier decides what's retryable;
the pool just ensures the next `acquire` returns a fresh
connection when needed.

### 6.1 The dead-slot-on-drop discipline

The pool's `PoolGuard` exposes `mark_failed()`. Op handlers MUST
call it before returning any of `Io`, `Closed`, or `Protocol` —
the three error variants that mean "the socket is unusable from
here on." On `Drop`, a failed guard transitions the slot to
`Closed` (next `acquire` opens fresh); an unmarked guard returns
the connection to `Idle` for reuse.

Server-side errors (`Server { code, .. }`) do NOT mark the slot
failed — the connection is healthy, just the op was rejected.

## 7. Server failover

For multi-server clients:

- Try the first server.
- If unreachable, try the next.
- Cycle through; if all fail, error.

The SDK can optionally use **client-side load balancing**:

- Round-robin: distribute requests across servers.
- Weighted: based on server capacity.
- Sticky-by-key: consistent assignment.

For a sharded single-node deployment, the SDK uses the routing table to send each request to the right shard's server.

## 8. The shard-aware routing

In clustered mode (a future major version), the SDK has the cluster's routing table:

- Each shard's home node.
- Authentication state per node.

```
client.encode(...)
  → SDK consults routing table
  → SDK picks the right node
  → SDK sends frame on a connection to that node
```

If routing is stale (`WrongShard` error), the SDK refreshes and retries.

## 9. The "bootstrap" pattern

The Client is initialized with bootstrap addresses:

```
client = Client::new(["host1:9090", "host2:9090"])
```

These addresses are tried first. The SDK can be configured to learn the full membership from the cluster:

```rust
let client = Client::builder()
    .bootstrap(["host1:9090"])
    .discovery(Discovery::ClusterMember)    // Auto-learn other nodes
    .build();
```

Auto-discovery happens at startup and periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes).

## 10. Connection lifecycle hooks

The SDK exposes hooks for observability:

```rust
client.on_connect(|server| log::info!("Connected to {}", server));
client.on_disconnect(|server| log::warn!("Disconnected from {}", server));
client.on_handshake_failure(|server, err| log::error!("Handshake failed: {}", err));
```

These integrate with the application's logging / metrics.

## 11. TLS configuration

TLS is optional but recommended for production:

```rust
let client = Client::builder()
    .tls(TlsConfig {
        ca_cert: Some(load_ca_pem("/etc/ssl/ca.pem")?),
        client_cert: Some(load_pem("/etc/ssl/client.pem")?),
        client_key: Some(load_pem("/etc/ssl/client-key.pem")?),
    })
    .build();
```

The TLS implementation uses the language's standard library (`rustls` for Rust, OpenSSL bindings elsewhere).

## 12. Authentication

Multiple methods:

- Token: a bearer token.
- Mutual TLS: client cert authenticates.
- API key: a per-application key.
- (Custom): pluggable auth.

```rust
let client = Client::builder()
    .auth(AuthMethod::Token("eyJ..."))
    .build();
```

The auth credential is sent on connection establishment, not per-request.

## 13. Connection limits

To prevent connection exhaustion:

- Max total connections (default 32).
- Max per server (default 8).
- Max queued requests waiting for a connection (default 1024).

If queued requests exceed the limit, new requests fail fast with `Overloaded` (a client-side overload, not a server-side one).

## 14. The "graceful close"

When the Client is dropped:

```
1. New requests fail with ClientClosed.
2. In-flight requests are awaited (with timeout).
3. Connections are gracefully closed (FIN).
4. Resources released.
```

The user can also explicitly close:

```rust
client.close().await?;
```

## 15. The "shutting down server" handling

Brain may indicate it's shutting down:

- Sends a `BYE` frame (graceful close per [§04.03 opcodes](../04_wire_protocol/03_opcodes.md)).
- The SDK marks the connection as draining.
- New requests for this server go elsewhere.
- In-flight requests are given a chance to complete.

Graceful shutdown reduces error rates during maintenance.

## 16. Connection metrics

The SDK exposes:

- Connection count (per server, total).
- Connection age.
- Bytes sent/received.
- Frames sent/received.
- Errors (per type).

Surface via the SDK's metrics interface.

## 17. The "never disconnect" anti-pattern

Some SDKs aggressively reconnect on any error. This can amplify problems (the SDK floods the network with reconnects).

Brain's SDK uses exponential backoff for reconnects:

- First reconnect attempt: immediate.
- Second: 100ms delay.
- Third: 500ms.
- ... up to 30s max.

Backoff resets on successful reconnect.

## 18. The "circuit breaker" option

For applications wanting circuit-breaker behavior:

```rust
let client = Client::builder()
    .circuit_breaker(CircuitBreaker {
        failure_threshold: 10,
        reset_timeout: Duration::from_secs(60),
    })
    .build();
```

After failure_threshold consecutive failures, the SDK opens the circuit; new requests fail fast for reset_timeout. After timeout, circuit half-opens; one request tested.

This integrates with the application's circuit-breaker patterns.
