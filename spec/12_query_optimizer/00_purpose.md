# 12. Query Optimizer

> **TL;DR.** The query planner picks a strategy (exact vs HNSW, ef_search level, fan-out, filter order, inline-text vs IDs) using simple decision rules — no cost-based optimization, no query rewriting, planning budget under 50 µs. The executor runs the strategy: embed the cue, search HNSW, read the arena and metadata in parallel, merge results, marshal the response. Hosts the VSA algebra module (bind/bundle/unbind over HRR vectors) used in PLAN and REASON. Predictable latency, no surprise plans.

## What this spec defines

The pipeline that converts a wire-protocol request into a sequence of operations against the storage layer (arena, WAL, metadata, ANN), and assembles the response.

The two halves:

- **Query planner** — chooses how to satisfy a request. Picks ef_search values, decides between fast paths and slow paths, plans cross-shard fan-out.
- **Execution engine** — runs the plan. Concurrency, batching, error handling.

This document specifies how Brain plans and executes requests. It bridges between the wire protocol (which defines what comes in and goes out) and the storage layer (which holds the durable state).

## What this document covers

- The lifecycle of a request from receipt to response.
- The planner — how Brain chooses an execution strategy.
- The executor — how Brain runs that strategy.
- Cost estimation, fan-out, and merging across shards.
- Concurrency between operations on a shard.
- Failure handling at the planner/executor level.

## What this document does not cover

- **Connection management.** Defined in [04. Wire Protocol](../04_wire_protocol/00_purpose.md).
- **Operation semantics.** Defined in [05. Operations](../05_operations/00_purpose.md).
- **Sharding decisions.** Defined in [16. Sharding & Clustering](../16_sharding/00_purpose.md).
- **Background work.** Defined in [15. Background Workers](../15_background_workers/00_purpose.md).

## 1. The role of planning

A request like "RECALL with this cue, K=10, kind=Episodic" can be satisfied many ways. The planner picks one:

- Use exact (brute-force) search? Or HNSW?
- ef_search = 64 (fast) or 128 (more recall)?
- Fan out to all shards or just the agent's shard?
- Pre-filter on metadata or post-filter?
- Return text inline or just IDs?

The planner makes these decisions based on:
- The request's parameters.
- The shard's current state (size, recent activity).
- Cost estimates.
- Quality requirements (the client's K and confidence).

## 2. The role of execution

Once the plan is chosen, the executor runs it:

- Issue read transactions on the metadata store.
- Call the embedder to compute query vectors.
- Call HNSW search.
- Read the arena.
- Apply filters.
- Marshal results into a response.

The executor handles concurrency: subqueries to multiple shards run in parallel; embedding and HNSW search overlap; result merging happens as data arrives.

## 3. The pipeline shape

```
[Connection layer]         (04. Wire Protocol)
      │
      ▼ (request frame)
[Validation + parsing]
      │
      ▼ (typed request)
[Planner]                  (this document)
      │
      ▼ (execution plan)
[Executor]                 (this document)
      │
      ├─→ [Embedder]       (07. Embedding Layer)
      ├─→ [Storage layer]  (08. Storage / 10. Metadata)
      └─→ [Result merger]
      │
      ▼ (response)
[Response framing]
      │
      ▼ (wire frame)
[Connection layer]
```

The planner and executor are Brain's "brain" — where strategy is chosen and orchestrated.

## 4. Latency budget

For a typical RECALL with K=10:

| Stage | Latency budget |
|---|---|
| Validate + parse | < 10 µs |
| Plan | < 50 µs |
| Embed cue | 5-10 ms |
| HNSW search | 1-2 ms |
| Metadata lookup (per result) | 1-5 µs × K |
| Filter and merge | < 100 µs |
| Frame and send | < 50 µs |
| **Total** | **~10-15 ms** |

The embedder dominates. Other stages are a small fraction of the total. The planner aims to not become a meaningful part of the latency.

## 5. Throughput target

Per shard, sustained throughput:

- ENCODE: ~1K-5K/sec (limited by group commit and embedder).
- RECALL: ~5K-20K/sec (limited by embedder and HNSW).
- LINK / FORGET: ~5K-10K/sec (limited by group commit).

Across all shards (multiple shards in parallel): roughly N × shard throughput, where N is the number of cores.

## 6. The simplicity preference

The planner is intentionally simple compared to a SQL query optimizer. Brain does not have:

- Cost-based optimization with statistics.
- Query rewriting.
- Multi-stage plans with intermediate materialization.

Instead, Brain uses:

- Decision rules: "if the request has X, do Y".
- A small cost estimator for picking ef_search and over_factor.
- Predictable execution.

This keeps planning fast (< 50 µs) and predictable (no surprise latency from the planner).

## 7. The "no surprise" principle

A request's latency should be predictable. Two requests with the same shape should have similar latency. The planner doesn't introduce variance through complex decision-making.

When the planner has multiple options, it picks based on simple, stable rules. Adaptivity is in the executor (e.g., re-querying with higher ef if too few results), not in the planner's strategy choice.

## 8. The relationship to operations

The five core operations (ENCODE, RECALL, PLAN, REASON, FORGET) are different shapes of requests. Each has its own planning rules. Subsequent files cover each.

Brain also has admin operations (snapshots, recover, stats). These are more straightforward — typically a single operation against the storage layer with light planning.

## 9. The error path

A request can fail at many stages: validation, embedding, search, storage. The executor handles errors uniformly:

- Catch the error.
- Map it to a wire-protocol error code.
- Build an error response.
- Log details (with trace context).

The error response is sent on the same stream as the request. The client sees a structured error.

## 10. The role in Brain

The planner+executor are Brain's request-handling muscle. Most code paths flow through them. They're where:

- Quality vs latency trade-offs are made.
- Cross-shard coordination happens.
- Concurrency is orchestrated.

They're also where most of Brain's runtime cost is — embedding and search, both initiated and orchestrated here.

## 11. VSA algebra

The planner crate also hosts the **VSA algebra module** — Vector-Symbolic Architecture primitives used to bind / bundle / unbind typed predicates over Holographic Reduced Representation (HRR) vectors. VSA ships as a callable algebra module (see [`./06_vsa_algebra.md`](./06_vsa_algebra.md)).

The module is wired but **not yet plumbed into PLAN / REASON executors** — that integration lands in a future version. The initial release ships the deterministic codebook, bind/bundle/unbind operators, and an `analogy_query` API exposed for tools and experimentation.
