# 16.02 Latency Targets

The latency targets Brain v1 must meet, on the reference hardware, with the reference workload.

## 1. The setup

- Hardware: 16-core x86_64, 64 GB RAM, NVMe SSD.
- Data: 1M memories per shard.
- Load: steady-state mixed workload (70% recall, 25% encode, 5% other).
- Concurrency: 100 concurrent clients.

## 2. The targets (single-shard)

### 2.1 Substrate (cognitive primitives)

| Operation | p50 | p95 | p99 | p99.9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ENCODE | 8 ms | 15 ms | 25 ms | 50 ms |
| RECALL (K=10, no text) | 5 ms | 12 ms | 20 ms | 40 ms |
| RECALL (K=10, with text) | 7 ms | 18 ms | 30 ms | 60 ms |
| PLAN (depth 3) | 4 ms | 10 ms | 18 ms | 35 ms |
| REASON (depth 3) | 8 ms | 20 ms | 35 ms | 70 ms |
| FORGET | 3 ms | 8 ms | 15 ms | 30 ms |
| LINK | 2 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms | 20 ms |
| UNLINK | 2 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms | 20 ms |

These are MUST targets for v1.

### 2.2 Knowledge layer — entity operations (phase 16)

Measured at 100K entities per shard. Phase-16 perf gate; substrate workload assumptions in §1 apply.

| Operation | p50 | p95 | p99 | p99.9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ENTITY_CREATE | 1 ms | 3 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms |
| ENTITY_GET | 0.5 ms | 1 ms | 2 ms | 5 ms |
| ENTITY_UPDATE | 1 ms | 3 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms |
| ENTITY_RENAME | 1 ms | 3 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms |
| ENTITY_MERGE | 5 ms | 15 ms | 25 ms | 50 ms |
| ENTITY_UNMERGE | 5 ms | 15 ms | 25 ms | 50 ms |
| ENTITY_TOMBSTONE | 1 ms | 3 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms |
| ENTITY_LIST (limit=100, prefix filter) | 2 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms | 20 ms |
| ENTITY_RESOLVE (tier 1 — exact / alias) | 0.5 ms | 1 ms | 2 ms | 5 ms |
| ENTITY_RESOLVE (tier 2 — trigram fuzzy) | 5 ms | 15 ms | 30 ms | 60 ms |

### 2.3 Knowledge layer — statement operations (phase 17)

Measured at 1M statements per shard. Phase-17 perf gate; substrate workload assumptions in §1 apply.

| Operation | p50 | p95 | p99 | p99.9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| STATEMENT_CREATE (Fact, 3 evidence) | 2 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms | 25 ms |
| STATEMENT_CREATE (Preference, auto-supersede) | 3 ms | 8 ms | 15 ms | 30 ms |
| STATEMENT_CREATE (Event) | 2 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms | 25 ms |
| STATEMENT_GET | 0.5 ms | 1 ms | 2 ms | 5 ms |
| STATEMENT_SUPERSEDE (explicit) | 3 ms | 8 ms | 15 ms | 30 ms |
| STATEMENT_TOMBSTONE | 1 ms | 3 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms |
| STATEMENT_RETRACT | 1 ms | 3 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms |
| STATEMENT_HISTORY (chain ≤ 10 versions) | 1 ms | 3 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms |
| STATEMENT_LIST (subject filter, current_only, ≤ 100 results) | 2 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms | 20 ms |
| STATEMENT_LIST (predicate filter, ≤ 100 results) | 3 ms | 8 ms | 15 ms | 30 ms |
| `statements_contradicting()` internal | 2 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms | 20 ms |

CREATE numbers assume the inline evidence path (≤ 8 evidence entries) and ~7 secondary index writes per `statement_create` ([§19/03 §2](../19_statements/03_storage.md)). Overflow path adds ~5 ms per chunk for the overflow row write.

### 2.4 Knowledge layer — relation operations (phase 18)

Measured at 1M relations per shard. Phase-18 perf gate; substrate workload assumptions in §1 apply.

| Operation | p50 | p95 | p99 | p99.9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RELATION_CREATE (any cardinality, ≤ 5 evidence) | 3 ms | 8 ms | 15 ms | 30 ms |
| RELATION_CREATE (ManyToOne auto-supersede) | 4 ms | 10 ms | 20 ms | 40 ms |
| RELATION_GET | 0.5 ms | 1 ms | 2 ms | 5 ms |
| RELATION_SUPERSEDE (explicit) | 4 ms | 10 ms | 20 ms | 40 ms |
| RELATION_TOMBSTONE | 1 ms | 3 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms |
| RELATION_LIST_FROM (entity + type filter, ≤ 100 results) | 2 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms | 20 ms |
| RELATION_LIST_TO (entity + type filter, ≤ 100 results) | 2 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms | 20 ms |
| RELATION_TRAVERSE (depth=1, default branching) | 5 ms | 12 ms | 25 ms | 50 ms |
| RELATION_TRAVERSE (depth=2, default branching) | 15 ms | 30 ms | 50 ms | 100 ms |
| RELATION_TRAVERSE (depth=3, default branching) | 30 ms | 60 ms | 100 ms | 200 ms |

CREATE numbers assume inline evidence + 3–4 secondary index writes per `relation_create` (RELATIONS + BY_FROM + BY_TO + BY_EVIDENCE; ×2 directional writes if symmetric). Cardinality auto-supersede adds ~1 ms for the pre-create lookup + the old-row rewrite + index flip.

TRAVERSE numbers assume default `max_branching_factor = 1000` per [§20/04](../20_relations/04_traversal.md) §4. Pathological super-nodes (single relation with > 1000 out-edges) truncate at the cap and emit a tracing::warn for operator visibility.

### 2.5 Knowledge layer — deferred targets

- **ENTITY_RESOLVE (tier 3 — embedding HNSW)** lands when the entity HNSW is wired into the resolver (phase 21). Target placeholder per the phase-16 doc: p50 ≤ 5 ms at 100K, ≤ 50 ms at 1M. Final numbers set in phase 21.
- **ENTITY_RESOLVE (tier 4 — LLM)** lands in phase 21 with the LLM extractor. Latency is gated by the model + cache hit-rate; target is "tail under 1 s with cache warm, queued under 5 s cold."
- **Statement HNSW semantic search** — phase 21 when the embedding worker populates the HNSW. Phase 17 writes / reads only; semantic search target lands with the worker.
- **Cross-shard RELATION_TRAVERSE** — phase 23 query router. Phase 18 ships same-shard only.
- **Query routing (RRF fusion across retrievers)** — phase 23.
- **Admin** opcodes — phase 22.

### 2.6 Knowledge layer — schema operations (phase 19)

Measured at 50-definition schema documents (typical user-facing
schema size). Phase-19 perf gate; substrate workload in §1.

| Operation | p50 | p95 | p99 | p99.9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SCHEMA_UPLOAD (parse + validate + persist) | 5 ms | 15 ms | 30 ms | 60 ms |
| SCHEMA_VALIDATE (parse + validate only) | 3 ms | 10 ms | 20 ms | 40 ms |
| SCHEMA_GET (by version) | 1 ms | 3 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms |
| SCHEMA_LIST (per-namespace) | 2 ms | 5 ms | 10 ms | 20 ms |

UPLOAD numbers assume small schemas (≤ 50 type definitions). Larger
schemas (~500 definitions) take proportionally longer for the parse +
validate pass. Persistence cost is dominated by the bulk of
secondary writes (entity_types, predicates, relation_types entries).

### 2.7 Knowledge layer — extractor operations (phase 20)

Measured at single-extractor dispatch over a 4 KiB memory body.
Phase-20 perf gate; substrate workload in §1.

| Operation | p50 | p95 | p99 | p99.9 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pattern extractor (regex match + project) | 30 µs | 70 µs | 100 µs | 300 µs |
| Classifier extractor (feature + inference) | 5 ms | 10 ms | 15 ms | 30 ms |
| Audit-row write (primary + 3 indexes) | 200 µs | 600 µs | 1 ms | 2 ms |
| `audit_by_memory` (limit 100) | 500 µs | 1 ms | 2 ms | 5 ms |
| `audit_by_extractor` (limit 100) | 500 µs | 1 ms | 2 ms | 5 ms |

Pattern numbers assume ≤ 6 patterns per extractor at typical
specificity. Classifier numbers assume the bundled `brain.basic_ner`
(small distilled BERT or rule-based fallback) — larger classifiers
scale linearly with inference cost.

ENCODE's overall P99 (§2.1, 20 ms) absorbs at most one classifier
extractor synchronously per memory; additional classifier
extractors dispatch through the near-foreground queue
(§27/01 §3) and don't widen ENCODE's budget.

### 2.8 Knowledge layer — LLM extractor (phase 21)

LLM extractor latency is dominated by external API round-trip
times. CI benches use mock HTTP servers; production deployments
set their own SLOs and instrument via the audit table.

| Operation | p50 | p99 |
|---|---|---|
| `LlmExtractor::predict` (cache hit) | 1 ms | 5 ms |
| `LlmExtractor::predict` (cache miss, claude-haiku) | 600 ms | 3 s |
| `LlmExtractor::predict` (cache miss, gpt-4o-mini) | 800 ms | 4 s |
| Cost-budget skip path (no LLM call) | 200 µs | 1 ms |
| `LlmCacheDb::get` round-trip | 300 µs | 1.5 ms |
| `LlmCacheDb::put` round-trip | 800 µs | 3 ms |

LLM extractors run on the background queue (§27/01 §3) and don't
contribute to ENCODE's P99 budget.

### 2.9 Knowledge layer — LexicalRetriever (phase 22)

LexicalRetriever is per-shard and runs against the tantivy
indexes laid out in §26/01. Filters and BM25 parameters per
§23/02. The text-indexer workers in §27/02 maintain the indexes
on the near-foreground priority lane; phase 22 acceptance
benches use shard-local scale.

| Operation | p50 | p99 |
|---|---|---|
| Memory @ 100K, single-term | 10 ms | 50 ms |
| Memory @ 100K, multi-term + filter | 15 ms | 70 ms |
| Statement @ 1M, single-term | 10 ms | 50 ms |
| Statement @ 1M, multi-term + filter | 15 ms | 70 ms |
| `IndexWriter::commit` (256-doc batch) | 5 ms | 25 ms |

Hybrid query end-to-end latency (LexicalRetriever +
SemanticRetriever + GraphRetriever + RRF fusion) is in §2.10
below; phase 22 gates only the per-retriever LexicalRetriever
numbers above.

### 2.10 Knowledge layer — Hybrid query (phase 23)

Hybrid query latency is dominated by per-retriever wall-time;
RRF fusion (§23/01) and the filter chain (§24/00) add sub-ms
overhead. The phase-23 gate at sub-task 23.12 measures three
retrievers in parallel (semantic + lexical + graph at depth 1)
plus the cross-cutting operations.

Per-retriever single-call latency (sourced from §23/02 §8,
§23/03 §8, §23/04 §8 — the per-retriever specs):

| Retriever | Single-call p50 | Single-call p99 |
|---|---|---|
| `SemanticRetriever` (Memory or Statement, push-down filters) | 5 ms | 25 ms |
| `SemanticRetriever` `Both` corpora | 8 ms | 35 ms |
| `LexicalRetriever` (Memory @ 100K, single-term) | 10 ms | 50 ms |
| `LexicalRetriever` (Statement @ 1M, single-term) | 10 ms | 50 ms |
| `GraphRetriever` (`Star` depth=1) | 5 ms | 20 ms |
| `GraphRetriever` (`Star` depth=2) | 10 ms | 40 ms |
| `GraphRetriever` (`Subgraph` depth=2) | 15 ms | 60 ms |

Hybrid query end-to-end (parallel retrievers + RRF + filter):

| Operation | p50 | p99 |
|---|---|---|
| Hybrid 3-retriever, push-down filters | 10 ms | 50 ms |
| Hybrid 3-retriever, post-fusion filters only | 15 ms | 70 ms |
| Hybrid single-retriever (router-degraded) | 7 ms | 30 ms |
| `EXPLAIN` (plan-only, no execution) | 500 µs | 2 ms |
| `TRACE` (plan + per-retriever metadata, includes execution) | inherits hybrid + ~200 µs | inherits + ~1 ms |
| Filter chain (1 K candidates, full chain) | 1 ms | 5 ms |
| RRF fusion (3 lists × 100 items) | 100 µs | 500 µs |

Notes:

- The hybrid query end-to-end is approximately `max(per-retriever) + filter + fusion`, not their sum — retrievers run in parallel on the shard's executor.
- Production-scale validation (100 K memories / 1 M statements / 100 K entities) is the phase-14 acceptance gate; sub-task 23.12 validates these targets at the 10 K corpus scale used by the phase-22 / 23 bench harnesses.
- `EXPLAIN` skips the executor entirely — cost is plan construction (router + cost estimate + pre-filter computation).
- Streaming queries (limit > 100; §24/00 §"Streaming results") use the SUBSCRIBE wire path; per-emit latency is hybrid-query latency divided across the result chunks.

### 2.11 Phase perf gates

- **Phase 16 (sub-task 16.9)** — §2.2 entity targets at 100K entities.
- **Phase 17 (sub-task 17.10)** — §2.3 statement targets at 1M statements.
- **Phase 18 (sub-task 18.9)** — §2.4 relation targets at 1M relations.
- **Phase 19 (sub-task 19.10b)** — §2.6 schema targets at 50 definitions.
- **Phase 20 (sub-task 20.10)** — §2.7 extractor targets at single-extractor dispatch.
- **Phase 21 (sub-task 21.7)** — §2.8 LLM extractor targets at cache-hit + cost-budget skip + mock-API miss.
- **Phase 22 (sub-task 22.8)** — §2.9 LexicalRetriever targets at 100K memory / 1M statement scale.
- **Phase 23 (sub-task 23.12)** — §2.10 hybrid query targets at 10K corpus / 3 retrievers.

Phases verify on the dev workstation; production-reference numbers (16-core / 64 GB / NVMe per §1) are revalidated in phase 14's CI suite.

## 3. The breakdown

For RECALL p99 = 20 ms, time is spent:

- Wire / framing / authentication: ~0.5 ms.
- Embedder (cue → vector): ~5 ms (with cache hit) / ~15 ms (miss).
- HNSW search: ~2-5 ms (depends on K and ef_search).
- Metadata fetch (top-K): ~2-5 ms.
- Text fetch (if requested): ~3-5 ms.
- Response framing: ~0.5 ms.

Total: 13-30 ms across cases. The 20 ms p99 is achievable.

## 4. The cold-cache numbers

When the substrate just started and caches are cold:

- p99 latency ~2× normal.
- Returns to normal within ~5 minutes of warm-up.

These numbers don't apply during cold-cache; the warm-up phase is excluded from the targets.

## 5. The "first request" latency

The very first request after startup:

- May include connection setup, embedder model loading.
- Up to 10× the steady-state p99.

This is acceptable; subsequent requests are normal.

## 6. The factor "load level"

At low load (~10% of capacity): latency near p50.

At high load (~80% of capacity):

- p99 may rise 2-3×.
- This is acceptable trading.
- Operators monitor and scale.

## 7. The "tail" sensitivity

p99.9 latency is sensitive to:

- GC pauses (not applicable; Rust has no GC).
- I/O scheduling.
- Concurrent background work.

Brain's design minimizes tail variance:

- Per-core executors (no thread switching).
- Predictable I/O (io_uring).
- Smooth background work (incremental, yielding).

## 8. The "K" effect

For RECALL, K (number of results) affects latency:

- K=1: ~5 ms p99.
- K=10: ~20 ms p99.
- K=100: ~40 ms p99.
- K=1000: ~100 ms p99.

Larger K = more candidates to score; longer.

The 20 ms target is for K=10 (typical).

## 9. The "with text" effect

When the response includes memory text:

- Each memory's text fetch adds ~0.3-0.5 ms.
- For K=10: ~3-5 ms additional.

Hence the "20 ms (no text) → 30 ms (with text)" target gap.

## 10. The "filter" effect

Filters affect HNSW search:

- No filters: ~3 ms p99 search.
- Single filter (e.g., agent): ~5 ms.
- Multiple filters with low selectivity: may significantly increase search time (HNSW visits more candidates).

Targets assume typical filter selectivity (~10-50% of memories pass filter).

## 11. The "depth" effect on PLAN/REASON

Higher depth = longer:

- Depth 1: trivial; ~2 ms.
- Depth 3 (target): ~18 ms.
- Depth 10: ~50 ms.

Targets are at depth 3. Deeper queries are allowed but with higher latency.

## 12. The connection-establishment latency

A new TCP connection:

- TCP handshake: ~1 ms (local network) / ~10 ms (cross-region).
- TLS handshake (if used): additional ~1-3 ms.
- First request: above + normal request latency.

Typical SDKs use connection pooling; subsequent requests skip the connection cost.

## 13. The variability

Latencies vary run-to-run:

- ±10% is normal.
- ±30% indicates instability; investigate.

Benchmarks run multiple times; report median + std dev.

## 14. The "above 10M memories" trade

At 10M memories:

- HNSW search increases to ~5-10 ms.
- p99 RECALL: ~30-40 ms (vs 20 ms at 1M).

This is acceptable; Brain works at scale, with degraded latency.

The targets are for 1M; 10M is "supported but slower".

## 15. The acceptance check

The substrate is accepted if all p99 targets are met:

```
For each operation:
  Run a 10-minute load test.
  Capture p99 latency.
  Verify ≤ target.
```

The full benchmark suite runs nightly in CI.

## 16. The trade-offs

Brain optimizes for predictable latency, not minimum:

- A simpler design might achieve lower p50.
- Brain's design ensures p99 is not too far from p50.
- Tail is what users feel.

This is a deliberate choice. Some users prefer lower averages; Brain prefers tighter distributions.

## 17. The reporting format

Latency benchmarks report:

- Histogram (full distribution).
- Quantiles (p50, p95, p99, p99.9, p99.99).
- Mean, median, std dev.
- Min, max.

Quantiles are the primary metric. Mean is reported but secondary.

## 18. The "background work" effect

When background workers (decay, consolidation, rebuild) run:

- They yield CPU to operations.
- Operations should not see significant latency increase.
- A rebuild may add some pressure (~10-20% latency increase) but is rare.

Acceptance tests run with workers active.

## 19. The "warm-up" definition

For benchmarks:

- 5 minutes of warm-up at full load.
- Then 10 minutes of measurement.

Warm-up establishes:
- File system cache.
- Embedder cache.
- HNSW search heuristics.
- Allocator state.

Without warm-up: cold-start latencies dominate.

## 20. The realism

Targets reflect realistic AI agent workloads:

- Bursts of activity.
- Mix of operations.
- Production-scale data.

For non-realistic workloads (single-op, micro-benchmarks), latency may be much lower. Such results aren't reported as primary.
