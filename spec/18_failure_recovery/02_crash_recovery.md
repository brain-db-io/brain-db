# 18.02 Crash Recovery

How Brain recovers from crashes — the WAL-based recovery procedure.

## 1. The crash scenario

A "crash" is any abrupt termination:

- Brain process panics.
- OS kills the process (OOM killer).
- Power loss.
- Hardware reset.

In all cases, in-memory state is lost; on-disk state is what persists.

## 2. The recovery contract

After crash + restart:

- All committed data is recovered.
- No half-applied operations are visible.
- No data appears that wasn't committed.

In other words: crash recovery is "as if the crash never happened", up to and including the latest WAL-fsynced commit.

## 3. The on-disk state

What persists across crash:

```
data/<shard>/
├── arena.bin                # Vectors (mmap'd, but on disk)
├── wal/
│   ├── segment-N.bin        # WAL records (durable per pwritev2 RWF_DSYNC)
│   └── ...
├── metadata.redb            # Metadata (redb's transactions are durable)
└── hnsw_snapshot.bin        # Optional periodic snapshot
```

The arena, WAL, and metadata are all durable. The HNSW snapshot may or may not exist (it's an optimization).

## 4. The recovery procedure

```
1. Open the arena file.
2. Open the metadata store.
3. Read the latest checkpoint marker; identify durable_lsn.
4. List WAL segments; identify the start of unprocessed records.
5. Replay each WAL record:
   a. Verify CRC.
   b. Apply to metadata if not already applied (idempotent via LSN).
   c. Apply to arena if not already applied.
6. After all records replayed:
   a. The metadata is now caught up.
   b. The arena is consistent.
   c. The next_lsn is set to last_replayed_lsn + 1.
7. Build the HNSW (from snapshot + WAL diff, or fresh from metadata).
8. Start workers and request handlers.
```

Brain is now ready to serve.

## 5. The checkpoint

A checkpoint marker is in the metadata store:

```rust
struct Checkpoint {
    durable_lsn: LSN,             // All WAL records ≤ this have been applied to metadata
    timestamp: SystemTime,
    arena_size_bytes: u64,
    memory_count: u64,
}
```

The checkpoint is updated periodically (every minute or every N records).

The recovery starts from `durable_lsn + 1`. Records before this are guaranteed already applied.

## 6. The WAL replay

```rust
async fn replay_wal(state: &mut ShardState, from_lsn: LSN) -> Result<LSN> {
    let mut current_lsn = from_lsn;
    let segments = list_wal_segments(&state.dir)?;
    
    for segment in segments {
        if segment.last_lsn < from_lsn { continue; }
        
        let mut reader = WalReader::open(&segment.path)?;
        while let Some(record) = reader.next_record()? {
            if record.lsn < from_lsn { continue; }
            verify_crc(&record)?;
            apply_record(state, record)?;
            current_lsn = record.lsn;
        }
    }
    
    Ok(current_lsn)
}
```

Each WAL record is processed in order. Records are applied to the metadata and arena.

## 7. The CRC verification

Each WAL record has a CRC32C. During replay, the CRC is verified:

- If valid: process the record.
- If invalid: log critical; depending on policy, halt or skip.

A bad CRC indicates corruption in the WAL — typically a hardware issue. Brain's default is to halt; recovery requires investigation and possibly a snapshot restore.

## 8. The "torn write" handling

A torn write is a partially-written record (e.g., crash mid-pwrite).

The wire framing detects torn writes:

- Each record has a length prefix.
- If the actual data ends short, the record is truncated.
- Brain ignores truncated records at the tail of the WAL.

Truncated records mean the operation didn't fully commit. Their data isn't visible. Subsequent ENCODEs / etc. are correct.

## 9. The replay performance

Replay speed depends on record types:

- ENCODE: arena write (~5 µs each), metadata write (~10 µs each). ~50 µs total.
- FORGET: tombstone update (~10 µs).
- Other: similar.

For 100K records: ~5-10 seconds. For 1M records: ~50-100 seconds.

The checkpoint cadence keeps the replay window bounded. Typical replay: 100K-1M records (1 hour's worth).

## 10. The HNSW reconstruction

Two paths:

### Path A: from snapshot + WAL diff

If a snapshot exists:

```
1. Load HNSW from snapshot file.
2. Apply WAL records since the snapshot.
3. Now caught up.
```

Fast (~10s of seconds).

### Path B: fresh from metadata

Without a snapshot:

```
1. Build HNSW from scratch.
2. For each active memory in metadata: add to HNSW.
```

Slower (~1-10 minutes for 1M memories). But simpler; no snapshot to maintain.

Brain prefers Path A when a snapshot is available; falls back to Path B otherwise.

## 11. The startup time bound

Recovery startup time:

| Memory count | With snapshot | Without snapshot |
|---|---|---|
| 100K | ~5 sec | ~10 sec |
| 1M | ~10-30 sec | ~1-2 min |
| 10M | ~30 sec - 2 min | ~5-15 min |

For latency-sensitive deployments, take regular HNSW snapshots.

## 12. The post-replay verification

After replay:

- The next_lsn matches the last replayed record + 1.
- The arena's expected slot count matches metadata.
- The HNSW node count matches active memory count.

Mismatches indicate corruption or a bug. Brain logs and may refuse to come up.

## 13. The "WAL gap" detection

If a record is missing (gap in LSN sequence):

```
Records ... 1000, 1001, 1003, 1004 ...
          missing 1002
```

This indicates:
- WAL retention deleted a needed record (bug).
- Disk corruption.
- Manual file manipulation.

Brain detects gaps via LSN continuity check. Refuses to come up; restoration from backup needed.

## 14. The "no committed data lost"

Assuming no corruption:

- All operations that received a success response are recovered.
- Operations that didn't get a success response may or may not be (the WAL might or might not have been fsynced).
- Operations that received an error are not applied.

Brain's contract: an operation that got "success" is durable. An operation that got "error" is not applied. Operations in between (no response yet) are ambiguous; the application should retry.

## 15. The retry-after-crash semantics

When a client retries an operation after Brain crashed:

- Brain is recovering or restored.
- The client's RequestId is in the idempotency table (from before crash, if applied).
- The retry hits the idempotency cache; returns the original response.

So clients don't see duplicates after recovery, as long as the WAL captured the original.

## 16. The "incomplete recovery"

If recovery encounters errors that prevent full success:

- Brain logs and refuses to come up.
- An operator decides:
  - Fix and retry.
  - Restore from backup.
  - Recover partial state (advanced; requires manual procedures).

Brain doesn't auto-degrade — it prefers fail-stop to silent partial recovery.

## 17. The recovery metrics

Per recovery:

- `brain_recovery_count_total`: incremented each restart.
- `brain_recovery_duration_sec`: how long it took.
- `brain_recovery_records_replayed`: how many WAL records.
- `brain_recovery_last_unixtime`: when last recovery happened.

These help operators track recovery patterns.

## 18. The "warm restart" optimization (future)

For planned restarts (operator-initiated):

- Brain can pre-emptively trigger a checkpoint.
- WAL replay window is minimal.
- Recovery is fast.

Brain does this on graceful shutdown. Crash recovery has the full WAL window to replay.

## 19. The recovery testing

In CI:

- Tests crash at random points; verify recovery is correct.
- Compare pre-crash state to post-recovery state.
- Verify no data loss for committed operations.

Brain's CI runs hundreds of crash scenarios per release.
